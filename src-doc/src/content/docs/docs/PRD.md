# **Problem Description**

Currently, the Health Enhancement Systems that OSU uses is quite costly. Additionally, there lacks customization to meet the needs and preferences of our school's faculty and staff. Events are hosted by HES and cannot be created by OSU FSF Administrators. With such a high demand and user attendance in the HES events, OSU FSF wants to provide and create their own events for users to sign up. Currently, there is no application to have users interact with each other and track their progress as compared to HES. 

## **Scope**

### Scope: Events Management and Participation

The scope for this project will allow faculty members to create events and give instruction on how to live a healthier lifestyle through videos and other methods of presenting this information.  Our stretch goals include: hooking up fitness tracking devices to the platform, allowing faculty members to be able to post their progress, setting personal fitness goals, and a nutrition tracker.

The scope of the new application will consist of the ability to create events that teams will participate in. Participation is defined as accumulating steps to contribute to your team total. Stretch goals include:

1. The automatic grouping of members given previous statistics, keeping teams balanced
2. Individual/team based reports after an event has concluded
3. Further customization to the events, such as a different type of event (i.e., yoga), or the ability to make the event non-team based (i.e., individual)

The scope for this product will be limited to faculty being able to start and host events and allow users to register to these events and track their progress for these events. Stretch goals include, seeing other people’s projects on the events, AI generated, and nutrition and meal planning. 

## **Use Cases**

### Walktober

Walktober is a community-wide challenge event in October that promotes physical fitness offering fun walking events and encouraging participants to move and get active. Joining the Walktober event connects you with a community of participants, allows you to track walking steps to contribute to your team to gain points for rewards, and incentivizes healthy behavior.  Currently, the Walktober event is hosted on the Health Enhancement Systems (HES) website. An organization may host a walktober event through the HES website by paying a setup fee, and the cost of one of three programs for each participant. The program options are as follows:
![prices](https://github.com/OregonStateUniversity/osu-fsf/assets/102546859/57b04220-6ec9-4fcc-9791-3567d20ff9c8)

These prices are very unreasonable for the services that HES provides. Our project will come at very little cost and will be more customized for the OSU faculty experience.  

# **Purpose and Vision (Background)**

Our mission is to build a vibrant community within OSU while fostering a culture of wellness and fitness. We are committed to providing a user-centric fitness application tailored specifically for faculty and staff at OSU, with the aim of promoting and inspiring greater health and fitness engagement.

We envision a future where faculty and staff at OSU not only lead healthier lifestyles but also find joy and motivation in their wellness journeys through our OSU-themed and engaging fitness app. Our application, designed exclusively for the University, will create a seamless and enjoyable wellness experience, encouraging widespread participation.

Unlike the current system, HES, which is both expensive and generic, our fitness application will be accessible at no cost to users, offering innovative features that leverage the unique location and geography of the University to further enrich the wellness journey of our community.

## **Stakeholders**

## **Preliminary Context**

### **Assumptions**

- We will find a way to accurately track user steps

- We will have until the end of Fall term to prove core functionality

- We will be able to use trustworthy libraries

- We will have users that can provide feedback

- Faculty members will be motivated by incentives like “leaves” for walktober

- The final product will need little to no maintenance after our graduation

- Event organizers will have the tools to create dynamic events that promote participation

- Faculty members will be technically proficient enough to use the application

- The Ideal logic registration system will be integrated with the application and users will have no trouble registering

## **Constraints**

- Integrating with the ideal logic registration system.  Since it’s an existing system, we might have issues requesting data if they don’t already have systems in place for it.

- Maintainability.  We are not aware of how the project will be maintained after we graduate.  We are aspiring for a bug-free implementation, but this could add more time due to testing. In order to stay flexible, we included Supabase in our initial plans. Supabase can be hosted via their managed service or it can be self-hosted. We know that an AWS backend is a possible (and perhaps even likely) outcome. It’s important to keep libraries or technologies that we choose to be compatible with AWS. 

- Time.  To fully test this application the best way to do it is by initiating an event.  These events can last up to a month, which means that we need to have a production build at least a couple of months in advance so it can be user-tested on a large scale.

## **Dependencies**

We need a way to request data from IdealLogic.  If users register through that system then we need some of their information so they can sign up for events.  We also need a test user base so they can provide feedback like satisfaction, bug occurrences etc..

# **Market Assessment and Competition Analysis**

Our primary competition is the Health Enhancement Systems application. It is proprietary and costly for FSF at OSU.

### IdealLogic Registration Software

Users register on the ideologic platform purchased by OSU. Mobile app and Web app that we are developing are not directly connected to the OSU infrastructure. We need to find a way to easily take the registration emails or users, and bring them to the back office app so that users that have downloaded the app can find and participate in the event. The preferred option would be that the ideologic platform offers an API endpoint for us for retrieve the information required.

In addition to participants, we could also retrieve classes from the software so that our members can track in their apps the fastest there are registered for.

### Steps Tracking

Apple Developer documentation exists for gathering all sorts of information regarding steps:

- [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmpedometer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmpedometer)

Apple Developer documentation also has core libraries for calculating distance from coordinates, and how to receive location information in the background:

- [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmpedometer)

Similar documentation for accessing a pedometer exists for Android:

- [https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion#sensors-motion-stepcounter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmpedometer)

As well as location libraries/functions:

- [https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion#sensors-motion-stepcounter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmpedometer)

### Activities Tracking

In addition to tracking steps through the phone pedometer we might want to track other activities, such as distance through watches from third-party providers, such as Fitbit, Garmin, or the Apple Watch.

All third-party providers have an API that could be used once users authorize access to retrieve their information.

# **Milestones and Timeline**

**By Tasks:**  

- **Design** 

Responsible for the look and feel of the application and creating the initial designs for

the front end. The front-end developers will try their best to replicate these designs as

closely as possible.

- **Frontend**

Responsible for writing the code that drives the client-side portion of the application.

This includes efficient communication with the backend, and proper data caching

techniques, and ensuring that end-user data is correctly handled and not lost

- **Backend**

Responsible for writing the code that drives the server-side portion of the application.

This includes handling connections made from client-side code, proper handling, and

cold-storing of application information, and ensuring that end-user data is secure and

accessible where needed

- **Scrum Master**

Responsible for facilitating the communication and collaboration between team

members. Also ensures that the scrum framework is being followed so that the project

runs smoothly

- As we continue with the project timeline, roles could be switched between the team until a

  unique strong point is discovered by each member. Although the work will be different, tasks

  should be evenly distributed in terms of difficulty.

# **Goals and Success Metrics**

![](https://holocron.so/uploads/ba93ec25-goal-and-success-met.jpg.jpeg)

# **FAQ’s**

- What are some ways we can promote this app for best results?

- What are some application features we can implement to promote user engagement and user fitness in a healthy manner?

  What will testing look like for individuals since our users are limited to OSU faculty?

- How will events be added to the application? Through engineers or admins?

- Will we need specific login credentials for users and admins?

- How will we verify/transfer authentication codes from IdealLogic for events users sign up for?

- Will the application be OSU-themed or should we look into UX designs best for users? 

- How much similarity will we have to the current application OSU uses for these types of events hosted? (HEC website)

  Will we have metrics implemented in the application to help with future development?

# **Out of Scope**

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Maybe use AI in some way for this project.

- **Diet**: Fitness app can only help people get involved, the food diet will become our disadvantage. 

- **Maintenance**: App is maintained after the team graduate. 

- **Users**: People who are disabled or sick, some of the functions in the app might not fit them.

- **User Interactions**: A robust messaging system.  It will probably only be one chat room because the user base is so small.  But this promotes a large group of people to be closer to one another.
